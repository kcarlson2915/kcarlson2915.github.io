	<p>Welcome to my personal website. I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at Pathpoint. Previously, I've worked at Samsara and at OpenTable in San Francisco. I graduated from Berkeley in May 2016. For now this website just hosts some of my photography portfolio as well as a link to my resume (which is likely far out of date).</p>
